    i had lived a blessed time, for from this instant
    i had most need of blessing, and "amen"
    i have almost slipp'd the hour.
    i have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
    i have begun to plant thee, and will labor
    i have done no harm. but i remember now
    i have lived long enough. my way of life
    i have no relish of them, but abound
    i have seen him do. how he solicits heaven,
    i have thee not, and yet i see thee still.
    i keep a servant feed. i will tomorrow,
i'll
    i'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
    i'll catch it ere it come to ground.
    i'll charm the air to give a sound,
    i'll come to you anon.
    i'll do, i'll do, and i'll do.
    i'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
    i'll prove the lie thou speak'st. 
    i look'd toward birnam, and anon, methought,
    implored your highness' pardon, and set forth
    impostors to true fear, would well become
    i must become a borrower of the night
    i must not look to have; but in their stead,
in
    in a most fast sleep.
    in an imperial charge. but i shall crave your pardon;
    in borrow'd robes?
    in deepest consequence-
    in doing it, pays itself. your highness' part
    in drops of sorrow. sons, kinsmen, thanes,
    industrious soldiership.
    in england and in ireland, not confessing
    in every point twice done, and then done double,
    in evils to top macbeth.
    in measureless content.
    in my most ill-composed affection such
    in my voluptuousness. your wives, your daughters,
    in nature is a tyranny; it hath been 
    in our last conference, pass'd in probation with you:
    in pious rage, the two delinquents tear
    in restless ecstasy. duncan is in his grave;
    in riddles and affairs of death,
    in seeking to augment it, but still keep 
    in such an honor named. what's more to do,
    in the affliction of these terrible dreams
    in the cauldron boil and bake;
    in the division of each several crime,
    in the great hand of god i stand, and thence
    in the poison'd entrails throw.
    in the unshrinking station where he fought,
    in this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow.
    in thunder, lightning, or in rain?
    in time! have napkins enow about you; here you'll sweat fort.
    into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
    into the flame.
inverness. court of macbeth's castle.
inverness. macbeth's castle.
    in viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
    in which addition, hail, most worthy thane,
    i pray you, school yourself. but for your husband,
    i pull in resolution and begin
    i put myself to thy direction and 
    is added to her wounds. i think withal
    i say, a moving grove.
    i see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl
    i see thee yet, in form as palpable
    is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,
    is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
    i shall be counsel'd.
    i sheathe again undeeded. there thou shouldst be;
    is he dispatch'd?
    i should cut off the nobles for their lands,
    i should report that which i say i saw,
    is left this vault to brag of.
    is mortals' chiefest enemy.
    is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
    is often laudable, to do good sometime
    i speak not as in absolute fear of you.
    is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
    is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is 
    is stopped, the very source of it is stopp'd.
    is't far you ride'!
    is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
    is there scarce ask'd for who, and good men's lives 
    is thine and my poor country's to command.
    is this a dagger which i see before me,
    is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
    is to avoid the aim. therefore to horse;
    is to receive our duties, and our duties
    i take my leave at once.                               exit.
    it had been as a gap in our great feast 
    it hath no end.
    i' the shipman's card. 
    i think, but dare not speak.
    i think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
    i throw my warlike shield! lay on, macduff,
    it is a banquet to me. let's after him,
    it is a peerless kinsman.                  flourish. exeunt.
    it is concluded: banquo, thy soul's flight,
    it is the bloody business which informs
    it is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it
    itself for being there?
    it shall make honor for you.
    it should not stand in thy posterity,
    it was for malcolm and for donalbain
    it was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
    it weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
    it were done quickly. if the assassination
    it would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
    i will advise you where to plant yourselves,
    i will drain him dry as hay:
    i will not be afraid of death and bane
    i would applaud thee to the very echo,
    i would not be the villain that thou think'st
    i would not wish them to a fairer death.
    i would, while it was smiling in my face,
    keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
    keeps still in dunsinane and will endure
kings,
    king, who all-hailed me 'thane of cawdor'; by which title,
knocking.
                                                knocking within.
    [knocking within.] knock, knock! who's there, in th' other

    my father is not dead, for all your saying.
    my genius is rebuked, as it is said
    my husband!
    my mind she has mated and amazed my sight.
    my thought, whose murther yet is but fantastical,
    my voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
    my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
    my wife kill'd too?
    nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse

    will all great neptune's ocean wash this blood
    will cheer me ever or disseat me now.
    will come to know his destiny. 
    will i with wine and wassail so convince
    will laugh a siege to scorn. here let them lie
    will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
    will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
    will these hands neer be clean? no more o' that, my lord, no

    wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
                                                 witches vanish.
    witch's mummy, maw and gulf
    with a new gorgon. do not bid me speak;
    with an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
               with a tree in his hand.
    with barefaced power sweep him from my sight
    with blood of thine already.
    with furbish'd arms and new supplies of men,
    with hidden help and vantage, or that with both
    with his surcease, success; that but this blow
    within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape, 
    within the belt of rule.
    within the volume of which time i have seen
    within this three mile may you see it coming;
    with most admired disorder.
    with my confineless harms.
    with one that saw him die, who did report
    with other graces weigh'd.
    without leave-taking? i pray you,
    without my stir.
    without our special wonder? you make me strange

    with such prophetic greeting? speak, i charge you.
    with tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
    with them they think on? things without all remedy
    with things forgotten. kind gentlemen, your pains
    with those of norway, or did line the rebel
    with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
    with twenty mortal murthers on their crowns,
    with twenty trenched gashes on his head,
    with wit enough for thee.
    wool of bat and tongue of dog,
    words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
    worthy to be a rebel, for to that
    would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    would create soldiers, make our women fight,
    would have inform'd for preparation. 
    would he were here! to all and him we thirst,
    would murther as it fell.
    would scour these english hence? hearst thou of them?
    would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
    wreck'd as homeward he did come.                drum within.
    yet grace must still look so.
    yet it shall be tempest-toss'd.
    yet i will try the last. before my body
    yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
    you do not give the cheer. the feast is sold
    you do unbend your noble strength, to think
    you greet with present grace and great prediction
    you look but on a stool.
    you may deserve of him through me, and wisdom 
    young fry of treachery!
  young siward, his son
  young siward. no, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
  young siward o thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
  young siward. the devil himself could not pronounce a title
  young siward. what is thy name?
    you owe this strange intelligence, or why
    your charms and everything beside.
    your face, my thane, is as a book where men
    your favors nor your hate.
    your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,
    your majesty loads our house. for those of old,
    your matrons, and your maids could not fill up
    your noble friends do lack you.
    your patience so predominant in your nature,
    your vessels and your spells provide,
    you shall offend him and extend his passion.
    you wait on nature's mischief! come, thick night,
